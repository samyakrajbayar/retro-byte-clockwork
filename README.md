# 🕰️ Retro Byte Clockwork

**Retro Byte Clockwork** is a fusion of vintage aesthetics and precise digital logic. This project provides a [Clock / Visualization / Tool] that brings a nostalgic, low-bit feel to modern timekeeping and task management.

## 📺 Overview

Retro Byte Clockwork is designed for those who appreciate the "clack" of old gears and the glow of cathode rays. Whether you're building a desktop companion, a terminal-based timer, or a retro-styled dashboard, this project provides the mechanical precision of a clockwork engine in a digital byte-sized format.

### ✨ Key Features

* **Retro Aesthetics:** Pixel-perfect UI/Terminal output inspired by 8-bit and 16-bit eras.
* **Modular Clockwork:** Extensible engine for handling time-based triggers and events.
* **Lightweight Core:** Optimized to run on minimal hardware (ideal for Raspberry Pi or microcontrollers).
* **Customizable Themes:** Switch between "Monochrome Amber," "CRT Green," and "Cyberpunk" palettes.

## 🚀 Getting Started
